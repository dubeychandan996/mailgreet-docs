## Understanding Email Marketing Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Learn the essential metrics that measure your email marketing success:

- **Open Rate**: Percentage of recipients who opened your email
  - Formula: (Number of opens ÷ Number of delivered emails) × 100
  - Industry average: 15-25% (varies by industry)
  - What it indicates: Subject line effectiveness and sender reputation

- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Percentage of recipients who clicked on a link
  - Formula: (Number of clicks ÷ Number of delivered emails) × 100
  - Industry average: 2-5% (varies by industry)
  - What it indicates: Content relevance and call-to-action effectiveness

- **Click-to-Open Rate (CTOR)**: Percentage of opened emails that received clicks
  - Formula: (Number of clicks ÷ Number of opens) × 100
  - Industry average: 10-20% (varies by industry)
  - What it indicates: Content quality and engagement

- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of emails that weren't delivered
  - Soft bounces: Temporary delivery failures (full inbox, server down)
  - Hard bounces: Permanent delivery failures (invalid email address)
  - Formula: (Number of bounced emails ÷ Number of sent emails) × 100
  - Healthy rate: Under 2%

- **Unsubscribe Rate**: Percentage of recipients who opted out
  - Formula: (Number of unsubscribes ÷ Number of delivered emails) × 100
  - Healthy rate: Under 0.5% per campaign
  - What it indicates: Content relevance, sending frequency issues

- **Spam Complaint Rate**: Percentage of recipients who marked as spam
  - Formula: (Number of spam complaints ÷ Number of delivered emails) × 100
  - Critical threshold: Keep under 0.1% to maintain good sender reputation

- **List Growth Rate**: How quickly your subscriber list is growing
  - Formula: [(New subscribers - Unsubscribes) ÷ Total subscribers] × 100
  - What it indicates: Overall health of your email marketing program
