**MailGreet** offers you the facility to verify the email addresses.
You can easily do either **Single Email Validation** or **Multiple Email Validation** using **Bulk Upload**.
Although, when you add new subscribers, their respective emails are automatically verified.
But apart from those subscribers' emails, you can also verify any emails you want.
