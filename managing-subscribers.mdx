## Subscriber Segments

### Understanding Segments vs. Groups

- **Groups**: Static collections of subscribers manually assigned or based on signup form
- **Segments**: Dynamic, rule-based collections that update automatically based on criteria

### Creating Segments

Create targeted segments based on subscriber data or behavior:

1. Go to **Subscribers** > **Segments**
2. Click **Create Segment**
3. Name your segment
4. Add conditions using the segment builder:
   - Subscriber fields (name, email, location, etc.)
   - Campaign activity (opened, clicked, etc.)
   - Group membership
   - Signup date
   - Custom fields
5. Combine conditions with AND/OR logic
6. Save your segment

### Example Segment Conditions

- Subscribers who opened a specific campaign
- Subscribers who clicked on a specific link
- Subscribers from a specific country
- Subscribers who joined after a certain date
- Subscribers who haven't opened any emails in 90 days
- Subscribers who have completed a purchase (custom field)

### Using Segments

Segments can be used for:
- Targeted campaign sending
- Re-engagement campaigns
- Cleaning your list
- Analyzing subscriber behavior
- Creating lookalike audiences for advertising

## Custom Fields

### Adding Custom Fields

Extend subscriber data with custom fields:

1. Go to **Subscribers** > **Fields**
2. Click **Add New Field**
3. Select the field type:
   - Text field
   - Number
   - Date
   - Dropdown
   - Radio button
   - Checkbox
4. Enter a field name
5. Add default value (optional)
6. Save the field

### Common Custom Field Uses

- Purchase history
- Product preferences
- Subscription tier
- Member since date
- Lead score
- Registration source
- Survey responses
- Customer ID

### Using Custom Fields in Campaigns

1. In the email editor, click where you want to insert the field
2. Select **Personalization**
3. Choose your custom field from the dropdown
4. Add fallback text for subscribers without data in that field

## Subscriber Management Best Practices

### List Hygiene

Maintain a healthy subscriber list by:
- Regularly removing inactive subscribers (no opens in 6+ months)
- Cleaning bounced email addresses
- Running re-engagement campaigns before removing inactives
- Verifying email addresses at signup
- Using double opt-in for new subscribers

### Segmentation Strategy

Improve engagement with effective segmentation:
- Segment by engagement level (highly engaged, moderately engaged, dormant)
- Create interest-based segments from click behavior
- Develop customer journey segments (new subscribers, regulars, VIPs)
- Use geographic segments for time-zone appropriate sending
- Build behavior-triggered segments (abandoned cart, browsed item)

### Privacy Compliance

Stay compliant with email regulations:
- Always get explicit consent before sending marketing emails
- Include an unsubscribe link in every email
- Honor unsubscribe requests promptly
