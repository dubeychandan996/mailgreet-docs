## Email Delivery Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Emails Not Being Delivered" icon="envelope-circle-xmark">
    **Symptoms:** Subscribers report not receiving emails, high bounce rates
    
    **Possible Causes & Solutions:**
    
    | Cause | Solution |
    |-------|----------|
    | Invalid email addresses | Use the Verify feature to clean your list |
    | Sender domain not verified | Verify your domain in Settings → Domains |
    | Poor sender reputation | Gradually increase send volume; remove inactive subscribers |
    | Content triggering spam filters | Avoid spam trigger words; balance images and text |
    | Missing authentication | Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records |
    
    <Tip>
    Send from a verified custom domain rather than generic email services to improve deliverability.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Emails Landing in Spam" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Common reasons emails go to spam:**
    
    - Subject line contains spam trigger words (FREE, ACT NOW, WINNER)
    - Too many images, not enough text
    - Missing or broken unsubscribe link
    - Sending to bought or scraped email lists
    - No physical mailing address in footer
    - Sending from unverified domain
    
    **How to fix:**
    1. Run a spam test before sending
    2. Ask subscribers to add you to their contacts
    3. Keep text-to-image ratio around 60:40
    4. Use authenticated sending domains
    5. Include a clear unsubscribe link
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="High Bounce Rates" icon="rotate-left">
    **What is a bounce?** An email that couldn't be delivered.
    
    **Types of bounces:**
    - **Hard bounce**: Invalid/non-existent address (remove immediately)
    - **Soft bounce**: Temporary issue (full inbox, server down)
    
    **Reducing bounce rates:**
    - Verify emails before adding to your list
    - Use double opt-in for new subscribers
    - Remove addresses that bounce multiple times
    - Keep your list clean with regular verification
    
    <Warning>
    Aim to keep bounce rates under 2%. Higher rates can damage your sender reputation.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
