## A/B Test Campaign

<Card title="Split Testing Campaign" icon="flask">
Test different versions of your email to optimize performance before sending to your full list.
</Card>

**What you can test:**
| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Subject Line** | "50% Off Sale" vs "Flash Sale: Half Price Today" |
| **Sender Name** | "MailGreet" vs "Sarah from MailGreet" |
| **Send Time** | Morning vs Afternoon delivery |
| **Content** | Different layouts, images, or CTAs |

**How it works:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Variants">
    Design two (or more) versions of your email with one key difference
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Test Group">
    Choose a percentage of your list to receive the test (e.g., 20%)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Winning Criteria">
    Define what "winning" means - higher open rate, more clicks, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Winner Selection">
    After the test period, the winning version is sent to the remaining list
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Test only ONE element at a time to clearly understand what drives better performance.
</Tip>

Automatically send emails when new content is published on your blog or website.

RSS campaigns require a valid RSS/Atom feed from your website. Most blog platforms generate these automatically.
