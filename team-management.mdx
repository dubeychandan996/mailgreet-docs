  <Accordion title="Principle of Least Privilege">
    Give team members only the permissions they need. Start with lower access and upgrade if necessary.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Regular Access Reviews">
    Periodically review who has access and remove users who no longer need it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Encourage team members to use clear profile names so you can identify who's who.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document Responsibilities">
    Make it clear who's responsible for what tasks to avoid confusion.
  </Accordion>
