## Fields

In MailGreet, a **field** stores the information when a new subscriber is added to the group.
The field can be anything such as first name, last name, email, etc.

At MailGreet, we offer seven system default fields to get you started:-
**Email**, **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Status**, **Email Status**, **Source**, **Location**.

<Info>

**Note**: You cannot **edit** or **delete** the **system default fields**.

</Info>

**Apart from these, a group is also to be selected for the new subscriber.**

Out of these seven system default fields, four fields are automatically set by the system such as:- 
**Status**, **Email Status**, **Source**, **Location**
The above fields are not shown in the dialog box when a new subscriber is added.

The fields tab is where the system default fields and custom fields are present as shown below:-

  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/field-dark.png"
  alt="Field Dark"
/>


## Custom Fields

Custom Fields are the fields that you create according to your own needs and rules. 
If you want to get additional information from the new subscriber, then you can create your own custom fields.
You can use these custom fields to better manage your new subscribers.

At **MailGreet**, you can create custom fields of the below field type:-
**Text**, **Number**, **Date**, **Yes/No**, **Email**, **Phone**, **URL**, **Dropdown**
