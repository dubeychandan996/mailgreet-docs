## Advanced Scheduling Features

### Recurring Campaigns

Set up campaigns that send on a regular schedule:

- **Weekly Newsletter**: Every Tuesday at 10 AM
- **Monthly Digest**: First Monday of each month
- **Daily Updates**: Every day at 8 AM

<Note>
Recurring campaigns automatically create new sends based on your schedule. You can edit content for each occurrence.
</Note>

### Timezone Optimization

Send emails at the same local time for all recipients:

**Example:** Schedule for "10:00 AM recipient's time"
- New York subscribers receive at 10:00 AM EST
- London subscribers receive at 10:00 AM GMT
- Tokyo subscribers receive at 10:00 AM JST

This ensures everyone gets your email during optimal hours regardless of location.
