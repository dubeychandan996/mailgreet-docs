## Churn Analysis

Monitor why subscribers leave:

### Unsubscribe Reasons

When subscribers opt out, analyze the reasons:

| Reason | Action to Take |
|--------|----------------|
| Too many emails | Reduce sending frequency |
| Content not relevant | Improve segmentation |
| Never signed up | Add double opt-in |
| Changed email | Normal churn, no action needed |

### Calculating Churn Rate

```
Monthly Churn Rate = (Unsubscribes + Bounces) / Total Subscribers × 100
```

<Info>
Healthy churn rates are typically under 2% per month. Higher rates indicate problems to address.
</Info>
