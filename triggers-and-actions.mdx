# Triggers & Actions

Automation in MailGreet is built on two core concepts: **triggers** (what starts a workflow) and **actions** (what happens in the workflow).

---

## What are Triggers?

A trigger is an event that starts an automation workflow. When the trigger condition is met, the workflow begins executing its actions.

<Tip>
Choose triggers that align with meaningful moments in your subscriber's journey.

## What are Actions?

Actions are the steps that execute after a trigger fires. You can combine multiple actions in sequence.

## Conditional Logic

Add conditions to make your workflows smarter:

### If/Else Conditions

Branch your workflow based on subscriber data:

```
IF subscriber.status = "VIP"
  → Send VIP Email
  → Wait 1 day
  → Send VIP Follow-up
ELSE
  → Send Standard Email
  → Wait 3 days
  → Send Standard Follow-up
```

### Filter Conditions

Only continue for subscribers matching criteria:

| Condition Type | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| **Field Value** | First name is not empty |
| **Group Membership** | Is in "Customers" group |
| **Engagement** | Has opened email in last 30 days |
| **Location** | Country is United States |
